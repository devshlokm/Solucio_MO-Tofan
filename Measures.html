        According to FEMA, the United States experiences about 1,200 tornadoes each year. 
        On average, tornadoes claim 227 lives and lead to annual damage costs of approximately
         $1,086,575,000.

        parts of Indiana and Kentucky causing $1.5 billion in damage. Winds were so severe 
        that debris was later found nearly 57 miles away.

            In the United States, hurricanes have cost a whopping $319.7 billion since 1992. 
            Hurricane Katrina alone takes the spot for most expensive, with a final total of 
            $108 billion in damage. Hurricanes are dangerous events that leave destruction 
            scattered in its wake. Even if you arenâ€™t located on a coast, you could still be 
            affected by a hurricane. Preparedness safety is important regardless of where you live. 
            According to DoSomething.org, approximately 80 percent of New Orleans was underwater 
            after Hurricane Katrina struck.
