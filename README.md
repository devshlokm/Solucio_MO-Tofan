# Solucio_MO-Tofan

Our motivation:

-When a disaster is about to hit with its full might, all that people need is hope and help at one place 
-The other disaster sites we tried to take inspiration from have been not efficiebntly working most of the time
-People tend to wander about for resources and shelters at the very last moment

Objective:

-With all of its potential put to use, our team has come with a website that caters to people in dire need of hope and help.
-The interface lets people find all the help at one place way before a disaster is predicted to hit.
-We plan to mention all the safety measures people can take, disaster shelters people can go to at the nick of time and showing the estimated path/time of a disaster.
